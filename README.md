The data written from the file is binary classification data, indicating whether blood tests and diabetes are determined. 
Through correlation analysis, the relationship between blood test results and diabetes judgment is investigated. 

In addition, a diabetes judgment prediction model was generated based on the data. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy, error matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC which are used as performance indicators in binary classification data.
